# Global Money Market

This is proof of concept of a money market that allows users to deposit from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, and tracks a global interest rate across all 3.

## Instructions

1. Spin up a local Omni devnet with `omni devnet start`. If you haven't installed the `omni` CLI, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.omni.network/tools/cli/).
2. Run `forge build`
3. Run `make deploy`

Congrats, your global money market is deployed.
